Overview
--------

Apache JMeter plugin for collecting performance metrics that are returned from a command remotely executed over an SSH connection.
Those metrics can be plotted over time and/or written to file (CSV/JTL).

This plugin is powered by [JMeter-Plugins](https://jmeter-plugins.org/) components.

![SSHMon Samples Collector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tilln/jmeter-sshmon/master/docs/sshmon_samples_collector.png)

Installation
------------
<!--
### Via [PluginsManager](https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PluginsManager/)

Under tab "Available Plugins", select "SSHMon Sample Collector", then click "Apply Changes and Restart JMeter".

### Via Package from [JMeter-Plugins.org](https://jmeter-plugins.org/)

Extract the [zip package](https://jmeter-plugins.org/files/packages/tilln-sshmon-1.0.zip) into JMeter's lib directory, then restart JMeter.
-->

### Via Manual Download

1. Copy the [jmeter-sshmon jar file](https://github.com/tilln/jmeter-sshmon/releases/download/1.0-SNAPSHOT/jmeter-sshmon-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into JMeter's lib/ext directory.
2. Copy the following dependencies into JMeter's lib directory:
	* [kg.apc / jmeter-plugins-cmn-jmeter](https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=kg/apc/jmeter-plugins-cmn-jmeter/0.5/jmeter-plugins-cmn-jmeter-0.5.jar)
3. Make sure to remove any older version of the jar file from JMeter's lib directory, e.g. `jmeter-plugins-cmn-jmeter-0.4.jar`
4. Restart JMeter.

Usage
-----

From the context menu, select "Add" / "Listeners" / "SSHMon Samples Collector".

Add one row for each metric to be collected from a remote command, such as `sar`, `iostat`, `vmstat`, `mpstat` etc.
**Important:** The command *must* return a single decimal floating point number or it will fail!
That means commands that return multiple rows and/or columns of console output will have to be filtered accordingly (e.g. via grep, awk, sed etc).

### Example

|Label|Host|Port|Username|Private Key (PEM)|Password|Command|Delta|
|-----|----|----|--------|-----------------|--------|-------|-----|
|CPU%|127.0.0.1|22|jmeter||secret|<code>sar -u 1 1&#124;awk '/^Average:/{print 100-$8}'</code>|‚òê|

* Connect to localhost on TCP port 22 with username *jmeter* and password *secret*
* Get CPU utilisation from [`sar`](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/sar1.html) (1 sample, 1 second)
* Filter that output for the row starting with *Average*
* Take the 8th column as idle percentage (this may vary depending on the OS) and calculate the difference to 100%
* Record and/or plot the value with label *CPU%*

*Note that the password is not masked so it may be useful to define a variable or property (e.g. on the command line -Juser.password=secret).*

### Public Key Authentication

1. Enter the username in the username field.
2. Make the private key available in PEM format and supply the *content* in the private key field. In most cases when this comes from a file use the JMeter function [`${__FileToString(pem_file)}`](http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/functions.html#__FileToString).
3. Enter the password for the private key in the password field.
4. Make sure the public key is on the server.

### Cumulative Values

In some cases the difference between sample values may be more interesting than the absolute value.
The *Delta* check box can be ticked to record/plot the difference from the previous sample.


Configuration
-------------

### Chart Settings

The tabs *Charts*, *Rows*, and *Settings* are only relevant in GUI mode.
For details refer to the [JMeter-Plugins wiki](https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/SettingsPanel/).

### JMeter Properties

The following properties control the plugin behaviour:
  * `jmeterPlugin.sshmon.interval`: Define the metrics collection interval in milliseconds (default=1 second).
  * `forceSSHMonFile` - (true/false) makes sure JMeter writes metrics to CSV file in the current directory if no filename is specified (default=false).

Limitations
-----------

* There is currently no validation of the server's key against known_hosts. All connections will be accepted.
* Samples are collected by a single thread, so if the command takes more than an insignificant amount of time to run, the frequency of sample collection will be limited.
A separate monitor may be used in this case.
